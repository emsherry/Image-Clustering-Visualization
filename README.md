# Clustering Techniques with Correlation Matrix and Signature Generation

This project is a Python implementation of various clustering techniques using correlation matrix and signature generation. The project includes tasks such as calculating correlation matrices, permuting data matrices, and generating signatures to rearrange similarity matrices. It also includes visualizing and extracting clusters using a weighted graph.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This project requires the following libraries:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

You can install these libraries using the following command:


### Installing

1. Clone the repo


2. Navigate to the project directory


3. Install the required libraries


## Datasets

The following datasets were used in this project:

- Iris
- Wine

The datasets were transformed to the required format, which includes the number of rows and columns and a grid of data.

## Tasks

The project includes the following tasks:

- Calculation of correlation matrix
- Discretization of correlation matrix
- Visualization of discretized matrix
- Permutation of data matrix
- Signature generation to rearrange similarity matrix
- Rearrangement of similarity matrix
- Weighted graph creation
- Cluster extraction using weighted graph
- Visualization of extracted clusters

## Results

The results of each task are shown in the `results` folder. The folder includes bitmap images of the correlation matrix, the permuted data matrix, and the correlation matrix after signature generation and rearrangement. The folder also includes images of the extracted clusters.

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request if you have any suggestions.
